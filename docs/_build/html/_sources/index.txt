Welcome to CBM's documentation!
=================================

Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods are a
collection of methods to analyze mathematically the metabolitic networks
of organisms.

Here, we introduce CBM.jl, a new toolbox that implements a
collection of COBRA methods. CBM.jl is written in the Julia

The purpose of CBM.jl is providing the broad range of functionality
found in the other COBRA toolboxes, while being easy to use and
provividing top of the line performance

We will actively maintain and improve CBM.jl, and in future releases,
we plan to add to CBM.jl a strain design toolbox, novel algorithms along
with implementing an interface to the libSBML parser to support models
expressed in the SBML format

CBM.jl is available at the `CBM github page <https://github.com/isebarn/CBM>`_
